## [PureMVC](http://puremvc.github.com/) C# MultiCore Framework - LEGACY IMPLEMENTATION 
### For the current implementation with support for targets such as Windows 10 and HoloLens, go [here](https://github.com/PureMVC/puremvc-csharp-standard-framework/wiki)

PureMVC is a lightweight framework for creating applications based upon the classic [Model-View-Controller](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model-view-controller) design meta-pattern. This is a C# port of the [AS3 reference implementation of the MultiCore Version](https://github.com/PureMVC/puremvc-as3-multicore-framework/wiki). 

Unit tests are included for VS2005 using NUnit Lite, and in the new style for VS2008 Pro with code coverage.
